# IRISnet Testnet Codename Fuxi

## What is IRISnet

IRIS network (a.k.a. IRISnet) is named after Greek goddess **Iris**, said to be the personification of the rainbow and the faithful messenger between heaven and humanity. IRIS network aims to build the foundation which facilitates construction of distributed business applications. IRIS hub will provide iServices, which allow resources such as data service and computing services being invoked across blockchains. To know more about IRISnet, please read this blog.

## How to Join Fuxi Testnet

### Step 1: Install Iris on Your Server

Please follow this [instruction](Install-Iris.md) to get **Iris** installed locally.

### Step 2: Run a Full Node

Please follow this [instruction](Full-Node.md) to get your full node running.


### Step 3: Upgrade to Validator Node

Please follow this [instruction](Validator-Node.md) to upgrade your full node to validator node.

### Deploy IRISHub Monitor

Please follow this [guide](../tools/Deploy-IRIS-Monitor.md) to get IRIHub monitor running on your side.


### Upgrade to Validator Node

You now have an active full node. What's the next step? 

If you have participated in the genesis file generation process, you should be a validator once you are fully synced. 

If you miss the genesis file generation process, you can still upgrade your full node to become a IRISnet Validator. The top 100 validators have the ability to propose new blocks to the IRIS Hub. Continue onto [the Validator Setup](Validator-Node.md).

### Setup a sentry node

A validator is under the risk of being attacked. You could follow this [guide](../validators/Setup-Sentry-Node.md) to setup a sentry node to protect yourself.

## Fuxi Incentivized Testnet
IRIS foundation plans to reward all the testnet participants who took part in the testnet. In Fuxi-2000 testnet, we invited several Chinese community members to join the incentivized testnet by completing tasks. In summary, 14 people finished the tasks and they will receive their rewards in genesis allocation.
