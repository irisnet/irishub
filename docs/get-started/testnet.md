# Join The Testnet

After IRIS Hub 1.0 upgrade of mainnet, **Nyancat Testnet** starts to operate as a stable application testnet which has the same version as the mainnet, so that the service providers of IRISnet can develop their apps on or interact with IRIShub without running a node or lcd instance.
